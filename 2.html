<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing<br>
the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most <br>
often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written<br>
 in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, <br>
including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,<br>
or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone <br>
technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, <br>
user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile <br>
applications.
