<p>

JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, <br>
dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted <br>
programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three <br>
core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make <br>
webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.<br>
The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it <br>
without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of <br>
the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, <br>
all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the<br>
 spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.<br>
