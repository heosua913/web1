<p>
The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where
documents <br>
and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),<br>
 interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.<br>
 [1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. <br>
 He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed <br>
 at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991,<br>
 first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the<br>
  general public on the Internet in August 1991.<br>
